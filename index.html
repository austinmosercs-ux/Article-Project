                Seven Seas is releasing the manga in English, and they describe it as:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Where there’s smoke, there’s a catgirl chainsmoking in this comedy manga!
                </li>
                <li>
                    A look at the daily troubles of one catgirl and her attempts to get her life together. Welcome to
                    Yani’s
                    apartment. Please don’t mind the smell. Yani is a catgirl with a seriously bad smoking habit. Every
                    time
                    she
                    tries to quit, she becomes weak to the cravings and gives in almost instantly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Behind on her rent and unable to hold down a job, her friends and sister rally around to help her
                    out.
                    But
                    when she’s using her pee to put out cigarette fires, they may just have their work cut out for them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Will she ever get her life together, or is she doomed to live as a chainsmoking slob forever?
                </li>
            </ul>
